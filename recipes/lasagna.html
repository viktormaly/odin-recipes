<h2>How to create a Mama Mia Lasagna</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
  <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions, until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
  <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, and sauté until softened, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add the ground beef or Italian sausage to the skillet. Cook until browned, breaking it up with a spatula as it cooks. Drain any excess fat.</li>
  <li>Stir in the tomato sauce and marinara sauce (or crushed tomatoes). Season with salt, black pepper, basil, and oregano. Add red pepper flakes if using. Simmer the sauce for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. If using red wine, add it now to deglaze the pan and let it reduce slightly.</li>
  <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and fresh parsley. Mix well until smooth. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
  <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
  <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
  <li>Repeat the layering process: add another layer of sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella cheese. Continue until you’ve used up all the ingredients, finishing with a layer of sauce and a generous sprinkling of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
  <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure it's tented slightly to avoid touching the cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the lasagna is bubbly and the cheese is golden and slightly browned.</li>
  <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This will help it set and make it easier to slice.</li>
  <li>Garnish with additional fresh parsley or basil, if desired. Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
